Analysis indicate extensive consumption of psychotropic substances, with traces of combat stimulants in the blood stream. This may indicate the Cultists are thrown into combat with little-to-none connection with the real world, which may explain their extreme resistance to pain."

# Gauss Tech

      STR_GAUSS_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "THE GAUSS WEAPON IS NEWLY DEVELOPED X-COM TECHNOLOGY. THIS SYSTEM'S MASS ACCELERATOR IS POWERED BY A COMPACT, LIQUID NITROGEN COOLED, FUSION REACTOR."
      
      STR_GAUSS_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The Gauss pistol uses magnetic acceleration technology, a new development in modern weaponry. It is accurate and functions above and below water, albeit bulky and heavy. "
      STR_GAUSS_PISTOL_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "Removable magazine loaded with ferromagnetic slugs, able to break through armor with ease. Gauss technology is a development of the Plasma mass acceleration technologies learned from the previous war."
      STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A step beyond the Gauss pistol, the rifle packs a real punch, with its twin magnetic accelerators. The extra room for conductive coils allows for more power efficiency."
      STR_GAUSS_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "The compact Zrbite-powered twin accelerators generates a powerful electric current along the barrel, impulsing a heavy tungsten ferromagnetic slug to tremendous speeds."
      STR_HEAVY_GAUSS_UFOPEDIA: "The scoped Heavy Gauss is cumbersome, but extremely effective. It operates with 3 mass accelerators and is virtually unstoppable, functioning as long-range anti-materiel support weapon."
      STR_HEAVY_GAUSS_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "The internal heavy Zrbite batteries provide an enormous amount of raw power, channeled by reinforced conductive coils. The oversized tungsten slugs are so heavy that few can fit inside the external magazine without making it impossible to carry by the regular soldier."

# Railguns Weapons Tech

# Starting topic 
    
      STR_RAILGUN_TECH: "Electromagnetism Tech"
      STR_RAILGUN_TECH_UFOPEDIA: "The research investment on Plasma technology allowed us to refine the practical application of electromagnetic energy. Our initial designs provide a simple yet effective system: a railgun. By accelerating a metallic projectile between two conductive rails using electrical pulses, we were able to create a powerful kinetic weapon."
      
      STR_PROTOTYPE_RAILGUN_RIFLE: "Prototype Rail Rifle"
      STR_PROTOTYPE_RAILGUN_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "A rather crude tech demonstrator model, fully build in Alien Alloys. Designed to engage heavily armored targets, its basically a rail system with a hastly put stock and pistol grip. There are concerns about the safety of the system, though." 
      STR_PROTOTYPE_RAILGUN_PISTOL: "Prototype Rail Pistol"
      STR_PROTOTYPE_RAILGUN_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "Scaled-down version of the larger Rifle. Although its projectile is technically unaffected by the gravity nor wind, the heavy recoil and rough handling limits the accuracy."
      
      STR_ENHANCED_RAILGUN_TECH: "Enhanced Electromagnetic Tech"
      STR_ENHANCED_RAILGUN_TECH_UFOPEDIA: "Based on the experience of the use of both our early Railguns and the Zrbite-powered Gauss weapons, we have developed a new set of Rail weapons. A sturdier frame allows for a harsher use, now reinforced with Aqua Plastics. After the perfectly understandable complains about the poor ergonomics of the first line of weapons, a major redesign brought them closer to a regular firearm, thus making it easier for novice user to acclimate. Rate of fire is reduced to diminish the extreme heat and avoid melting the rail system."
